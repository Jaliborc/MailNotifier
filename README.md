# MailNotifier :email:
MailNotifier is a small World of Warcraft addon that has two purposes: tracking how many unread mails the player has in the inbox and alerting him when new mail is received (plays a sound and flashes the minimap mail button).

### Features
* Tracks how many unread mails the player has in the inbox
* Alerts the player when new mail is received
* No configuration needed

### Limitations
Except when the player visits the inbox, it's impossible to know exactly how many unread mails he has. This is why Mail Notifier can only detect mails received while playing, and by comparing the mail senders list at login (ex: If you have 1 sender when you logout and 3 when you login, obviously you have at least received 2 more mails).
